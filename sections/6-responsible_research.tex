\section{Responsible Research}
To validate my research, it is important to reflect upon the proper acknowledgment of related work, reproducibility, integrity and privacy. Related work is cited using the IEEE citation method. This does not only include research papers, but also white papers, technical reports, and GitHub pages such as those of the SuperApp and BlockStack. 

Proper citations are of significant value for the reproducibility of the work. As this paper focuses on designing a framework, the most important factors that should be reproducible are the design decisions that were made based on the literature. 

Code has been released.

For the research to be reproducible, it should also be tested with the same data and produce the same results. This can easily be done by cloning the code and running the application. The result should be...


Make a claim about how safe the procedure is. How did you test it and how can others test this as well.
