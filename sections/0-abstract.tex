\begin{abstract}
Self-sovereign identity provides users of the internet control over their own data by letting them store it on their own device or in a decentralized way, such as a blockchain. The SuperApp is an SSI application currently under development by the Delft Blockchain Lab, but it is still lacking one of the core features of SSI, which is interoperability. Since most data in SSI solutions is sent using verifiable claims, this research first focuses on building a claim portability framework. This framework is built using a public key infrastructure. 
\textcolor{red}{(89 words) Something about usability and the framework itself. }
% The abstract should be short and give the overall idea:
% what is the background, the research questions, what is contribution, and what are the main conclusions.
% It should be readable as a stand-alone text (preferably no references to the paper or outside literature).
